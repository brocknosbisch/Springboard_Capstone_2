### Customer Churn
By Brock Nosbisch 

#### What is the problem you want to solve? 
The problem I am trying to solve is pretty common in most utility companies.  What is the chance that a person will turn off in XX number of days.

#### Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? In other words, what will your client do or decide based on your analysis that they wouldnâ€™t have done otherwise? 
My client is a natural gas company.  Being able to predict when a customer will turn off is crucial to the natural gas business.  By knowing when a customer will turn off, you can forecast future turn off work and also allow salesreps to reach out to those customers to try to get them to stay on.  

#### What data are you using? How will you acquire the data? 
The data I will use for this project comes from both internal data and external data sources (ex. NOAA weather data).  The data will be merged inside our internal data warehouse and will then be imported into the Python notebook.
