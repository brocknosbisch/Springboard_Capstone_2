### Customer Churn
By Brock Nosbisch 

#### What is the problem you want to solve? 
The problem I am trying to solve is pretty common in most utility companies. Customers turn off for a number of reasons so I will be creating a predictive model that will output a score representing the probability that a person will turn off in XX number of days.

#### Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? In other words, what will your client do or decide based on your analysis that they wouldnâ€™t have done otherwise? 
My client is a natural gas company. Being able to predict when a customer will turn off is crucial to the natural gas business. By knowing when a customer will turn off, workload planning and field operations can forecast future turn off work and plan for enough resources to be available to do the required work. Also, knowing when a customer turns off enables salesreps to reach out to those customers to try to get them to stay on but if the customer does want to turn off still, the salesrep can schedule that customer to turn off during a non-peak time. This will save the company in overtime costs and ensure the workers are working at 100% utilization.

#### What data are you using? How will you acquire the data? 
The data I will use for this project comes from both internal data and external data sources (ex. NOAA weather data).  The data will be merged inside our internal data warehouse and will then be imported into the Python notebook.
