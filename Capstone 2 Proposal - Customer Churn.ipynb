    "### Customer Churn\n",

    "#### What is the problem you want to solve? \n",
    "The overall problem I am trying to solve is pretty common in most consumer businesses, Customer Churn.  I will be going a few steps further than just looking at who is leaving though.  I want to:\n",
    "* Predict if a customer will turn off.\n",
    "* Give a probability of a customer turning off in a certain time frame (tbd).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? In other words, what will your client do or decide based on your analysis that they wouldn’t have done otherwise? \n",
    "My client is any energy company.  Being able to predict when a customer will turn off is crucial to the energy business.  Being in the natural gas industry means that several customers will turn off in the spring and turn on during the fall whenever it gets cold.  By knowing what customers are considered “Seasonal Customers”, customer reps can reach out to the customers to see how we can keep them on year-round.\n",
    "Also, being able to predict when a customer will permanently turn-off (not turn back on for 1+ year) can help in marketing to that customer to try to keep them as a customer.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What data are you using? How will you acquire the data? \n",
    "The data I will use for this project comes from both internal data and external data sources (ex. NOAA weather data).  The data will be merged inside our internal data warehouse and will then be imported into the Python notebook.\n",

    "#### Briefly outline how you’ll solve this problem. Your approach may change later, but this is a good first step to get you thinking about a method and solution. \n",
    "My approach to solving this problem is to get all the required data into our internal data warehouse and then merge/clean the data. I will then import the data into notebook, perform Data Wrangling / EDA, and test different machine learning algorithms to determine which works best for the problem I am trying to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What are your deliverables? Typically, this includes code, a paper, or a slide deck. \n",
    "My deliverables will be a jupyter notebook and slide deck that will be published to my github account. I will include all my findings and all documented python code."
